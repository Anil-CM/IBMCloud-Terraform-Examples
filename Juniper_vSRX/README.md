# HA Juniper vSRX deployment
This example will deploy an HA pair of Juniper vSRX network gateway appliances on to a set of newly created VLANs. Once the Juniper appliances have been created the code will also associate the newly created VLANs so that they are protected by the vSRX HA Pair. 

## Schematics Support
This example will also work with [IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-about-schematics).
